# empathy

## useful empathy

- open source software is the best by nature
- but corporations often steal it
- examples:

## ruinous empathy

- there is a russian story mentioned in the book radical candor
- i'm trying to find it online...
- a man loved his dog but its tail had to be removed
- his love increased the suffering
- he did not want to hurt the dog
- his solution was to chop off a little bit of the tail each day

## good empathy in software

- open source software is empathy driven
- for example linus created the kernen and git
- kernel because he did not want to pay for unix but he shared it with the world which is healthy empathy he could have been selfish which is destructive anti empathy
- git he created for his team because subversion was causing suffering
- git is effective beause he did not make it to take advage of people and profit from it which he could easily have done it created an entire industry
- he focused on data structure which makes the code easy

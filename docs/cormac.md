## existence

- the passenger
- stella maris
  - do i believe in an afterlife?  I do not believe in this one
  - to never have existed
  - that which drives the tale does not survive the tale
- counselor
  - the extinction of all reality
  - is a concept no resignation can encompass
- blood meridian
- no country
  - i got here the same way as the coin
- sunset limited

## reality

- suttree
  - not dressing the world in shabbier clothes than it is already wearing
- sunset limited
  - i do not regard my state of mind as some pessimestic view
  - i regard it as the world itself

## the rules

- counsellor
- suttree
- sunset limited
- stella maris
  - if the rules are not in the stuff
- no country
  - you have to call it or it wouldn't be fair
- blood meridian
  - they are all here for the dance
  - those who dance

## death

- stella maris
  - do i believe in an afterlife?  I do not believe in this one
- counsellor
  - the extinction of all reality
  - is a concept no resignation can encompass
- suttree
- sunset limited
  - the shadow of the axe hangs over every joy
  - every road ends in death
- no country
  - i got here same way as the coin now call it
  - you have to call it or it wouldn't be fair
  - you have been puttin it up your whole life you just didn't know it
- the road
  - i was afraid i was going to die
  - then i was afraid i was not going to die
- blood meridian

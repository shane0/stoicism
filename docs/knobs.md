# knobs

- you can reduce algorithms to a set of knobs
- good or bad they reflect whatever topic you are applying knobs to

## demonstrating expensive problems

- follow the money trail who profits from todays inconveniences?

## future

- cruds scenarios
- complex examples

## strength training

## periodic table

- simple conways game of life
- using periodic table
- or simple atoms or photons

## global economic knobs

- including values of finite resources and sustainablility
- think william rees has suggestions for these  

Global economic models simulate the economic activities and interactions of multiple countries or regions. These models help policymakers, researchers, and analysts to forecast economic trends, assess policy impacts, and understand global economic dynamics. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of typical **inputs** and **outputs** for these models:

### Inputs

1. **Macroeconomic Indicators**:
   - GDP, inflation rates, interest rates, unemployment rates, etc.
   - These indicators serve as baseline conditions and calibration points for the model.

2. **Trade Data**:
   - Exports and imports, trade balances, tariffs, and quotas.
   - Helps to analyze the flow of goods and services across borders and the impact of trade policies.

3. **Financial Data**:
   - Exchange rates, foreign direct investment (FDI), capital flows, and asset prices.
   - Important for understanding global capital movements and exchange rate impacts.

4. **Demographic Data**:
   - Population growth, age distribution, labor force participation rates.
   - Essential for projecting labor supply, demand for services, and government spending.

5. **Resource Prices and Availability**:
   - Prices of oil, minerals, and other commodities, and their global supply.
   - Models the impact of resource prices on production costs, inflation, and trade.

6. **Policy Variables**:
   - Tax rates, government spending levels, and fiscal/monetary policies.
   - Allows simulations of policy scenarios like interest rate adjustments, stimulus packages, or tax reforms.

7. **Technological Factors**:
   - Productivity growth, technology adoption rates.
   - Used to project economic growth through productivity and efficiency changes.

8. **Climate and Environmental Factors**:
   - Emission levels, climate policies, natural disasters, and carbon taxes.
   - Relevant for assessing the economic impacts of climate change and environmental policies.

### Outputs

1. **Economic Growth Projections**:
   - Forecasts of GDP growth, per capita income, and economic expansion or contraction.
   - Used for strategic planning and understanding long-term trends.

2. **Employment and Income Distribution**:
   - Projections of employment levels, wages, and income inequality.
   - Useful for analyzing social impacts of policies or economic conditions.

3. **Inflation and Price Levels**:
   - Expected inflation rates and changes in the consumer price index (CPI).
   - Helps in policy planning around price stability and inflation control.

4. **Trade Balances and Exchange Rates**:
   - Projections of trade surpluses/deficits and exchange rate movements.
   - Essential for understanding international competitiveness and currency risks.

5. **Fiscal and Monetary Impacts**:
   - Effects on government deficits, debt levels, and required fiscal adjustments.
   - Guides decisions on government spending, debt management, and interest rates.

6. **Environmental and Climate Outcomes**:
   - Emission projections, carbon footprint, and resource depletion levels.
   - Useful for evaluating the effectiveness of climate policies and environmental sustainability.

7. **Productivity and Innovation Projections**:
   - Impacts on productivity growth, innovation rates, and technological advancements.
   - Insightful for long-term competitiveness and efficiency improvements.

8. **Regional and Sectoral Effects**:
   - Breakdown of impacts on different regions and sectors (e.g., manufacturing, services).
   - Useful for understanding localized effects of global trends and policies.

These inputs and outputs enable stakeholders to make informed decisions, adjust policies, and prepare for future economic conditions based on simulated outcomes.

# build the discipline to think well live well be well

- these are my research notes on stoicism
- for now I'm adding some other subjects that are loosely related
- I think stoicism was derived from [buddhism](https://shanenull.com/buddhism/)
- I think it fails where it is egocentric and an ego is an illusion on top of an illusion so large sections of the topic are futile

## stoic challenges

- these are my research notes on stoicism
- in 2024 my son and I got some [stoic challenge card decks](challenge.md){ .md-button }
- these pages either are about a challenge card or a topic that emerges from a card
- some of those cards are about facing your deepest fears therefore this site can get very dark
- warning this is sort of hard mode some of these topics are extremely dark and challenging
- I think much of stoicism was derived from [buddhism](https://shanenull.com/buddhism/) they overlap

## my selfish altruism

- there is a book titled ecological overshoot by william catton
- it is the bible for doomers
- william liked to camp near mt rainier & overshoot impacted his campling lol
- a similar thing happens to me
- every summer I hike in the cascade mountains on the pacific coast trail
- and every year hikers have to fight and reroute due to forest fires
- so there are many pages here on that topic
- and beyond human maladaptation the universe itself is in overshoot
- see this page on [thermodynamics](entropy.md)

# space

- is there such a thing or is space filled with particles too small to observe

## space and buddhism

- shunyata is sort of spacial
- vs impermanence which is temporal

## Space Computations

**Classical Mechanics**

- Kepler's Laws of Planetary Motion
- Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation:
  $$
  F = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}
  $$
- Orbital Mechanics:
  - Orbital Velocity:
    $$
    v = \sqrt{\frac{GM}{r}}
    $$
  - Orbital Period:
    $$
    T^2 = \frac{4\pi^2}{GM}r^3
    $$

**Special Relativity**

- Lorentz Transformations
- Time Dilation
- Length Contraction

**General Relativity**

- Einstein Field Equations:
  $$
  R_{\mu\nu} - \frac{1}{2}Rg_{\mu\nu} = \frac{8\pi G}{c^4}T_{\mu\nu}
  $$
- Geodesic Equation
- Black Hole Solutions (Schwarzschild, Kerr, etc.)

**Cosmology**

- Friedmann Equations:
  $$
  \left(\frac{\dot{a}}{a}\right)^2 + \frac{k}{a^2} = \frac{8\pi G}{3}\rho
  $$
  $$
  \frac{\ddot{a}}{a} = -\frac{4\pi G}{3}(\rho + 3p)
  $$
- Hubble's Law:
  $$
  v = H_0d
  $$

These equations are fundamental to understanding the behavior of celestial bodies, the expansion of the universe, and the nature of gravity.

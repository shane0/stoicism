**Time**

**Classical Mechanics**

- Time as a Parameter: In classical mechanics, time is often treated as an independent parameter, flowing uniformly and independently of the system's state.

**Special Relativity**

- Time Dilation:
  $$
  t' = \frac{t}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
  $$
- Time as a Fourth Dimension: In special relativity, time is combined with the three spatial dimensions to form a four-dimensional spacetime continuum.

**General Relativity**

- Time as a Dynamic Quantity: In general relativity, the concept of time is more complex. The presence of mass and energy can warp spacetime, affecting the flow of time.
- Gravitational Time Dilation: Time passes more slowly in a stronger gravitational field.

**Quantum Mechanics**

- Time Evolution Operator:
  $$
  |\Psi(t)\rangle = e^{-i\hat{H}t/\hbar}|\Psi(0)\rangle
  $$
- Time-Independent Schr√∂dinger Equation:
  $$
  \hat{H}|\Psi\rangle = E|\Psi\rangle
  $$

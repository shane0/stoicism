# microstates

In statistical mechanics, a microstate refers to a specific configuration of a system at a microscopic level. For example, for a system of particles, a microstate specifies the position and momentum of each particle.

The number of microstates, denoted by $W$, is related to the entropy $S$ of the system through Boltzmann's formula:

$$
S = k_B \ln W
$$

where:

- $S$: Entropy
- $k_B$: Boltzmann constant
- $W$: Number of microstates

A higher number of microstates corresponds to a higher degree of disorder or randomness in the system.

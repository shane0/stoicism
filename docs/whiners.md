# whiners

![w](images/whiners.png)

## quick soliloquy

I was watching a drama sitcom today which is a silly thing to do

but it was about some whiners and got me thinking whining is probably somewhere in my stoic challenge decks and books

later I will search

I know I have a challenge card about being silent people generally view silence as some super power lol

that happens with dogs and people

tiny dogs tend to yap like they are some big dog and big dogs just stare at you like you owe them money lol

stoics were kind of next level whiners

I have an army and a kingdom and enough free time to spend most my days philosophizing...

but it's not virtuous enough I need higher virtues!

there is a buddhism video where an excellent teacher points something out, rephrasing from memory for now...

> SUFFERING OCCURS BECAUSE OUR MIND IS IN CONFLICT WITH REALITY!

humans we love to go into denial bottle up emotions then explode with breakdowns

or just leak it out slow and daily with complaints or whining I know I have that habit but as I practice stoicism and meditate it is reducing

- another quote about that from my level 1 class? - find it
